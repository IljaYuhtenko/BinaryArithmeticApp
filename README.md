# BinaryArithmeticApp
An application to practice binary arithmetic in network related tasks made as a part of learning CCNA material

# Supported tests
For now, as a first step, it gives one task: to determine subnet ID, broadcast address, prefix length and, possibly, number of usable addresses.
To ask for the last or not depends on the mask. The app will not ask that if the prefix is greater than 16.
The randomly generated mask will be between 8 and 30.
